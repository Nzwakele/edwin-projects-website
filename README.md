# edwin-projects-website

This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my projects, skills, and experience. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and Java. It includes a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes, making it easy to view on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

To run the website locally, simply clone the repository and open the index.html file in your browser. The website is divided into sections, including an About Me section, a Projects section, and a Skills section. Each section includes relevant information about my background, experience, and technical skills.

The website is designed to showcase my portfolio to potential employers or clients, and to demonstrate my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and Java. I welcome any feedback or suggestions on the website, and invite you to explore my projects and skills. Thank you for visiting!
